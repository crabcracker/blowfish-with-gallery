A radically customized version of Hugo theme [blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish), incorporating the Gallery element from [Track3](https://github.com/Track3)â€™s personal blog [Zakee's Planet](https://github.com/Track3/blog).

## Notice

When using the GitHub Pages link `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` in the form of a project site as the baseURL for a Hugo blog, the thumbnail images on the Gallery homepage cannot be displayed properly due to incorrect paths. The temporary solution adopted by this repository is to add the repository name before the file link of each preview image in `Gallery/photo folder/index.md`, such as changing `/gallery/2020-06-20/DSCF2839_t.webp` to `/blowfish-with-gallery/gallery/2020-06-20/DSCF2839_t.webp`.

If you use user site format of GitHub Pages link `https://<username>.github.io`, or custom domain as baseURL for your Hugo blog, you need to reverse the aforementioned changes.

The sample content in the Gallery comes from Track3's personal blog [Zakee's Planet](https://github.com/Track3/blog), which is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license.
